# learnopengl

Building the examples from the OpenGL tutorial https://learnopengl.com/ in Python as an exercise.

  - Requires *python3*, *glfw*, *pyopengl*, *glm*
  - I am still making my way through the tutorial, so still a lot to go
  - I build some of the original C++ examples when I was struggling to get my Python version to work.
